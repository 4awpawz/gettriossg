                <h2 id="lots-of-goodies-for-you-in-this-release">Lots of goodies for you in this release.</h2>
                <p>New features make this the most productive release of Trio yet, and major bug fixes make this the most stable release of Trio to date!</p>

                <h2 id="new-permalinks">New! Permalinks.</h2>
                <p>Though originally intended to provide flexibility as to where you wish to target the generation of your article pages, Trio&apos;s permalink implementation is general enough to be used for other use cases as well, such as grouping your fragment files into easily recognizable and manageable sub folders of root/source/fragments. Trio allows you to declare your permalinks in the trio.json configuration file as well as in individual fragments.</p>
                <h2 id="new-you-now-have-total-control-as-to-how-you-structure-your-blogs">New! You now have total control as to how you structure your blogs.</h2>
                <p><strong>* breaking change!</strong></p>
                <p>The source/fragments/blog folder, including the source/fragments/blog/tag, source/fragments/blog/category and the source/fragments/blog/archive folders are now gone. The articles folder is now a direct child of source/fragments, and that&apos;s where it always should have been.</p>
                <p>This is a breaking change and you might have to modify your projects&apos; blogs to conform to this change, but it is one that I hope you will all come to appreciate as you realize the flexibility that this, along with the new Permalinks feature, now affords you. I am truly sorry for any inconvenience that this may have caused you.</p>
                <p><strong>* Tip #1: You can continue to use the blog folder to host your generated blog exactly as prior versions of Trio had done.</strong></p>
                <p>To do so, you first have to make the source/fragments/blog/articles folder a direct child folder of the source/fragments folder. Then, you must add a permalink in trio.json that will direct Trio to generate your article pages in either the public/blog folder or in the release/blog/ folder, depending on which command you use to generate your project, which can be either build or release, respectively, as shown below:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-json">permalinks: [
    &quot;articles: blog&quot;
]</code></pre>
                <p><strong>* Tip #2: You can use an approach similar to Tip #1 above to name your generated blog&apos;s folder to something other than blog, such as to myblog, for example.</strong></p>
                <p>To do so, move the articles folder out of the blog folder as described above. Then, like above, you must add a permalink in trio.json, but this one will trigger Trio to generate your articles, categores, tags and archive pages in a folder called myblog:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-json">permalinks: [
    &quot;articles, blog: myblog&quot;
]</code></pre>
                <h2 id="new-incremental-build-now-watches-triojson-for-changes">New! Incremental Build Now Watches trio.json For Changes.</h2>
                <p>Now, when building incrementally while watching for changes, and you make changes in your project&apos;s trio.json configuration file, Trio will run a one-off build so that your changes can be applied to your site. You no longer have to terminate your incremental build, then run a one-off build to apply the changes you made in trio.json to your site, and then start another incremental build.</p>
                <h2 id="new-enhanced-collection-dataset-validation">New! Enhanced Collection Dataset Validation.</h2>
                <p><strong>* breaking change!</strong></p>
                <p>Beginning with v3, Trio can now property validate and generate warning messages when an item in a collection dataset is missing one or both of its required properties, namely its page name, and the data associated with that page.</p>
                <p>Prior to v3, you were able to name the property that you assigned the dataset item&apos;s data to to any legal property name as long as it adhered to JavaScript&apos;s object property naming conventions. However, this ambiguity prevented Trio from property validating each dataset item. To remedy this, beginning with v3.0.0, Trio requires that this property must be named &quot;data&quot;.</p>
                <p>This is a breaking changes, and I am truly very sorry for any inconvenience that this may have caused you, but I hope you agree that insuring the data integrity of these dataset items is very important.</p>
                <h2 id="improved-consistent-formating-for-error-and-warning-messages">Improved Consistent Formating For Error And Warning Messages.</h2>
                <p>A lot of cruft had built up regarding how error and warning messages were formatted. This version of Trio has attempted to address that by providing a more consistent format for both error and warning messages.</p>
                <h2 id="major-bug-fixes">Major Bug Fixes</h2>
                <p>Fixed - A bug (issue #98) that prevented you from creating a new project at the command line from within the new project&apos;s target folder.</p>
                <p>Fixed - A bug (issue #94) that would cause incremental build with watch to break when you would rename a fragment. Now, when you rename a fragment, Trio will run a one-off build to insure that its cache accurately represents the current state of your project.</p>
                <p>Fixed - A bug (issue #93) that would sometimes prevent articles from being generated if they didn&apos;t declare a category in their front matter.</p>
                <h2 id="upgrading-from-an-older-version-of-trio">Upgrading From An Older Version Of Trio.</h2>
                <p>Whenever you upgrade to a new version of Trio, you should always run a one-off build to insure that Trio&apos;s cache is updated to its current expectations:</p>
                <pre><code>$ trio build | b</code></pre>
